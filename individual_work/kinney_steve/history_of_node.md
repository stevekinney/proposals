## The story you'd like to tell

JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) were introduced by Netscape in 1996 as a competing specification to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Most recently, it was available in Netscape Communicator 4.0. The technology died in 2000, when Netscape removed it from Communicator 6.0.

JavaScript Style Sheets allowed you to define custom styling rules for your web pages. Cascading Style Sheets did have one thing missing, however: cascading. That said, JSSS allowed the developer to use the full weight of the language, including functions and conditionals to style the DOM.

In this talk, we’ll review the history of JSSS, examples of JSSS from the past, what it did better than CSS, what it did worse than CSS, what we can learn from JSSS, and—for the adventurous among us—using JSSS today. We'll even do some live coding with JSSS to see it in action.

We'll look at how some of the concepts present in JSSS—that didn't make it into CSS—re-emerged in technologies like React as well as Sass and LESS.
