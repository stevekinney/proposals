## The story you'd like to tell

This is a talk about promises: specifically ES6 promises. In this talk we're spend a few minutes talking about the theory behind promises and then we're dive into the nitty gritty of how to use ES6 promises in your applications today. We'll talk about browser support as well as polyfills for both Node/io.js and the browser.

Maybe you've used a promise library like [bluebird][] or [q][]—or maybe you've just used jQuery deferreds. That's cool, we'll talk about what's different and what's the same between your past experience and the ES6 specification.

Lastly, we'll talk a bit about how and when to use promises in your application. I'll show you some common use cases in real world code and we'll refactor some code from using callbacks to using promises.

A big part of the preparation of this talk will be coming up with fulfilling expectations for promise-based puns—unless, of course, this talk is rejected. Either way, we'll have settled this matter.
